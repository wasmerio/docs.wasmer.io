# Managing your Wasmer Edge apps with the `wasmer` CLI
Wasmer provides you with CLI commands to deploy and manage your applications on the Edge. 
The most important ones are `wasmer deploy` and the subcommands of `wasmer app`.

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** To deploy apps on Wasmer Edge an account is required. When
  deploying an app, you will be prompted to login if you are not already. 
</Callout>

<Callout>
  **Note:** This page describes in more detail the commands available in the
  CLI to manage your Wasmer Edge apps. To quickly create and deploy an app,
  refer to the [get started guide](/edge/get-started) or just
  [install](/install) the CLI and run `wasmer deploy`.
</Callout>

## Deploying an app (`wasmer deploy`)
To deploy an app to the Wasmer Edge, the user can use the `wasmer deploy` command.


```console
wasmer deploy --help

Deploy apps to Wasmer Edge [alias: app deploy]

Usage: wasmer deploy [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --wasmer-dir <WASMER_DIR>
          Set Wasmer's home directory

          [env: WASMER_DIR=/home/imago/.local/share/wasmenv/current]
          [default: /home/imago/.local/share/wasmenv/current]

      --cache-dir <CACHE_DIR>
          The directory cached artefacts are saved to

          [env: WASMER_CACHE_DIR=/home/imago/.wasmer/cache]
          [default: /home/imago/.local/share/wasmenv/current/cache]

  -v, --verbose...
          Generate verbose output (repeat for more verbosity)

      --registry <REGISTRY>
          The registry to fetch packages from (inferred from the environment by default)

          [env: WASMER_REGISTRY=]
      ...
```

The `wasmer deploy` command has many flags, but does not have any mandatory
argument. Its objective is that of loading the user-provided data - thus,
possibly, [publishing](/registry/cli) a package as well - in Wasmer Edge and
providing the needed informations for the user to manage their application.

Based on the kind of app the user wants to deploy, the `wasmer deploy`
command carries out different actions. In a nutshell, from the CLI perspective,
there are two kinds of deployment - just as mentioned above for the `wasmer app
create` command - which entail two different flows. 

In one case the user refers to a package already existing in the registry - in
this case [the `package` field](/edge/configuration#package)
in the `app.yaml` file will refer to an identifier of the package (e.g.
`wasmer/hello`). In the other case, when the user has a custom local package
that they want to upload and use, the `package` field will contain the path to
the package's manifest.

In the latter case, the `wasmer deploy` command recognizes that the user
might want to edit some of the metadata about the package and, if needed,
prompts the user to decide on that regard. One example is that of the package
version: in interactive mode, if the `--bump` flag was not given, the user will
be asked if a patch version bump is needed. This, however, is not the only way
to specify the version of a package: for a deeper dive into this matter, check
out the [`publish` page](/registry/cli). 

Once these matters are decided upon, this deployment flow concludes just as the
former: your app is available!

```shell
wasmer deploy                                             
...
✔ Who should own this app? · <your-app> 
✔ What should be the name of the app? · <your-app-name> 
✔ What would you like to deploy? · Choose an existing package
✔ What is the name of the package? · wasmer/hello
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes

<Callout type="info">
  **Note:** The `wasmer deploy` command is a _top level alias_ of 
  `wasmer app deploy`: running any of the two commands will result in the execution
  of the same program. 
</Callout>

## Managing your app (`wasmer app` subcommand)
Once an app is deployed, the `wasmer` CLI provides a number of tools to manage
it. 

### Gathering informations about apps (`wasmer app info` and `wasmer app get`)
In order to fetch structured informations about your app, you can use the
`wasmer app get`, that provides the user with a number of informations about
the app structured as a YAML value, ranging from the identifier of the app to
the raw value of the `app.yaml` config file used to create the app. 

The `wasmer app info` command provides a synthesis of these informations, in
particular the app name, the owner of the app, and relevant URLs.

```
wasmer app info       
  App Info  
→ Name: <your-app-name> 
→ Owner: <you> 
→ URL: https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
→ Unique URL: https://<app-id>.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard: https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>
```

Both these apps have the same user-facing structure: the user can provide an
app specifier in a format such as `your-name/your-app` or as the app
identifier, which is persisted in the `app.yaml` file upon deploying.

### Listing your apps (`wasmer app list`)
In order to show all the apps linked to your account, you can use the `wasmer app list` command.

### Creating an app (`wasmer app create`)
The Wasmer CLI allows users to intentionally create an app, but if a user runs
`wasmer deploy` without an app available, the app creation process will be
triggered.

```console
wasmer app create --help

Create a new Edge app

Usage: wasmer app create [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --template <TEMPLATE>
          A reference to the template to use.

          It can be either an URL to a github repository - like `https://github.com/wasmer-examples/php-wasmer-starter` -  or the name of a template that will be searched for in the selected registry, like `astro-starter`.

      --package <PACKAGE>
          Name of the package to use

  -v, --verbose...
          Generate verbose output (repeat for more verbosity)

  ...
```

This subcommand offers a wide range of flags, mostly to make `wasmer app
create` functional as a non-interactive command as well.

In the interactive case, the user will be guided through the steps to create an
app: entering the name of the owner of the app (if not
provided via the `--owner` flag) and the name of the app (if not provided via
the `--name` flag).

Once the metadata about the app are available, the user must decide the _kind_
of app they want to deploy. 

```shell
wasmer app create  
...
? What would you like to deploy? ›
  Start with a template
❯ Choose an existing package
```

{/* [TODO]: Add link to templates list */}

Templates allow users to kickstart their custom application from one of the
available boilerplates like a static website, a php application, a javascript
worker and much more. Another possibility is that of creating an app from an
existing package: for example, as a starting step, the user can create the app
from an existing package, like
[`wasmer/hello`](https://wasmer.io/wasmer/hello).

```shell
wasmer app create 
...
✔ What would you like to deploy? · Choose an existing package
✔ What is the name of the package? · wasmer/hello
```
The result of this action is that the CLI will create a file called `app.yaml`
in the current working directory: 
```
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
name: <YOUR-APP-NAME>
owner: <YOUR-NAME> 
package: wasmer/hello
```

This file contains all the necessary informations required to deploy your app
to Wasmer Edge. To learn more about this configuration file, refer to the
[dedicated _Learn_ page](/edge/learn/apps). After having everything in place -
whether it is from templates or pre-existing packages - the command will ask
the user if they want to _deploy_ their app.
