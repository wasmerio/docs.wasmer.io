# WCGI Runner

WCGI allows you to use normal [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) applications in WebAssembly.
It is a simple wrapper around the WASI interface.

If you have a CGI program, just try to compile it to WebAssembly and WASI and run it with WCGI.

You can read more about WCGI here:

## Usage

To use the WCGI runner, you need to specify the runner for your package in your `wasmer.toml` file:

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" copy
# ...

[[command]]
name = "proxy"
module = "<your-module>"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wcgi"
```
