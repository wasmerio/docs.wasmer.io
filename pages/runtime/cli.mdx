# `wasmer run` CLI

Run a WebAssembly file or Wasmer container.

## Usage

### Run a Wasmer package

All packages published on [Wasmer Registry](/registry) can be run with the `wasmer run` command.

```bash copy
wasmer run python/python
```

Some commands, such as `cowsay` have multiple commands that we can run (eg. `cowsay` or `cowthink`)

```bash copy
wasmer run syrusakbary/cowsay --command-name=cowthink Hello world
```

If in your current dir you have a `wasmer.toml` file, you can simply run the local package with:

```bash copy
wasmer run .
```

Wasmer run also allows running from URLs (in case a package is hosted on a different registry).

```bash copy
wasmer run https://wasmer.io/python/python
```


### Run a Wasm file

```bash copy
wasmer run my_program.wasm
```

#### Run a Wasm file with a custom compiler

```bash copy
wasmer run my_program.wasm --singlepass
```

> You can also use `--cranelift` or `--llvm` instead of `--singlepass`.

**Note on compiler licensing**: The Singlepass and LLVM compilers are now licensed under the Business Source License (BUSL-1.1), which restricts production use to Sponsors under the Wasmer Sponsorship Program. For non-production use or if you're a sponsor, you can continue to use these compilers. For production use without sponsorship, consider using the Cranelift compiler. For more information, see the [Runtime Features](/runtime/features) page or contact licensing@wasmer.io.

### Run a WASI or WASIX Module

You can pass the arguments that will be given to the WASI program:

```bash copy
wasmer run my_wasi_program.wasm -- arg1 arg2 arg3
```

You can also pass environment variables:

```bash copy
wasmer run my_wasi_program.wasm --env MYVAR=MYVALUE -- arg1 arg2 arg3
```

      --no-tty
          Disables the TTY bridge

      --enable-async-threads
          Enables asynchronous threading

      --enable-cpu-backoff <ENABLE_CPU_BACKOFF>
          Enables an exponential backoff (measured in milli-seconds) of the process CPU usage when there are no active run tokens (when set holds the maximum amount of time that it will pause the CPU) (default = off)

      --journal <JOURNALS>
          Specifies one or more journal files that Wasmer will use to restore and save the state of the WASM process as it executes.
          
          The state of the WASM process and its sandbox will be reapplied using the journals in the order that you specify here.
          
          The last journal file specified will be created if it does not exist and opened for read and write. New journal events will be written to this file

      --enable-compaction
          Flag that indicates if the journal will be automatically compacted as it fills up and when the process exits

      --without-compact-on-drop
          Tells the compactor not to compact when the journal log file is closed

      --with-compact-on-growth <WITH_COMPACT_ON_GROWTH>
          Tells the compactor to compact when it grows by a certain factor of its original size. (i.e. '0.2' would be it compacts after the journal has grown by 20 percent)
          
          Default is to compact on growth that exceeds 15%
          
          [default: 0.15]

      --snapshot-on <SNAPSHOT_ON>
          Indicates what events will cause a snapshot to be taken and written to the journal file.
          
          If not specified, the default is to snapshot when the process idles, when the process exits or periodically if an interval argument is also supplied.
          
          Additionally if the snapshot-on is not specified it will also take a snapshot on the first stdin, environ or socket listen - this can be used to accelerate the boot up time of WASM processes.

      --snapshot-period <SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL>
          Adds a periodic interval (measured in milli-seconds) that the runtime will automatically take snapshots of the running process and write them to the journal. When specifying this parameter it implies that `--snapshot-on interval` has also been specified

      --http-client
          Allow instances to send http requests.
          
          Access to domains is granted by default.

      --deny-multiple-wasi-versions

  -e, --entrypoint <ENTRYPOINT>
          The entrypoint module for webc packages

  -i, --invoke <INVOKE>
          The function to invoke

          Generate a coredump at this path if a WebAssembly trap occurs

      --hash-algorithm <HASH_ALGORITHM>
          Hashing algorithm to be used for module hash

          Possible values:
          - sha256:  Sha256
          - xx-hash: XXHash

  -h, --help
