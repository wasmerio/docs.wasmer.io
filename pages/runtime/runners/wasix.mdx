# WASIX Runner

WASIX is the long-term stabilization and support of the existing [WASI ABI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/application-abi.md)
plus additional non-invasive syscall extensions that complete the missing
gaps sufficiently enough to enable real, practical, and useful applications to be compiled and used.

WASIX was created by the Wasmer team to speed up the Wasmification of codebases around the world!

You can check more about WASIX on the [website](https://wasix.org/).

## Usage

To use the WASIX runner, you need to specify the runner for your package in your `wasmer.toml` file:

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" copy
# ...

[[command]]
name = "proxy"
module = "<your-module>"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wasi"
```
