# Patching COOP/COEP Headers for GitHub Pages Deployment

## Introduction

Deploying web applications on GitHub Pages that require Cross-Origin Isolation
can be challenging due to lack of control over HTTP headers. This guide
demonstrates using [`coi-serviceworker`][coi-gh] to patch
[`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`][coop] (COOP) and
[`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`][coep] (COEP) headers, enabling features like
`SharedArrayBuffer`.

## Step 1: Prepare coi-serviceworker

1. **Download**: Obtain `coi-serviceworker.js` from its [GitHub
   repository][coi-gh] or via npm (`npm i --save coi-serviceworker`).
2. **Place File**: Ensure `coi-serviceworker.js` is located next to your
   project's index file or in a parent directory.

## Step 2: Integrate with HTML

- **Add Script Tag**: In your HTML file, include:
   ```html
   <script src="coi-serviceworker.js"></script>
   ```
- **First Load Behavior**: This script reloads the page on the first user visit,
  registering a service worker that emulates COOP and COEP headers.

## Step 3: Customization (Optional)

- **Customize Behavior**: You can define a `window.coi` object to customize the
  service worker's behavior. Options include `shouldRegister`, `shouldDeregister`,
  `coepCredentialless`, `doReload`, and `quiet`. Check out the project's README
  for more.

## Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

- **Commit and Push**: Upload your changes to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages in
  your repository settings.
- **Test**: Verify that your application works correctly on GitHub Pages with
  the required cross-origin isolation.

## Notes

- **HTTPS Requirement**: Your page must be served over HTTPS or localhost.
- **Separate File**: `coi-serviceworker.js` must not be bundled with your app
  and should be served from your origin.
