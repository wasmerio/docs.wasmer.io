# Wasmer Edge

Wasmer Edge is a next-generation cloud platform powered by WebAssembly, Wasmer and WASIX.

You can move now your applications to the Edge and scale them like serverless at extremely affordable prices.

## üê• First Steps

To start using Wasmer Edge, check out the [Getting Started](/edge/get-started/) guide.

To understand how the platform works, check out the [Architecture](/edge/architecture) documentation.


## Features

Wasmer Edge has many features, and we have many more in development:

- **Stateless** HTTP workloads: <br/>
  You can use [proxy](/edge/learn/deployment-modes#proxy) or to run web servers in the edge. [WCGI](/edge/learn/deployment-modes.mdx#wcgi) mode to run CGI in the edge.
  If you are interested about TCP/UDP, [please reach us so we can enable it for you](/edge/learn/deployment-modes#tcpudp-applications).
- **Automatic scaling**: <br/>
  Workloads will be served by the Wasmer Edge network, on the servers closest
  to the user, and will scale automatically to meet the demand.
- **Auto-domains and aliases**: <br/>
  Each deployed app will be reachable through a unique URL, `[NAME].wasmer.app`.
  You can also configure additional aliases.
- **Versioned deployments and rollback**:<br/>
  App deployment versions are tracked.
  You can always access previous versions though a special URL, and rollback to
  previous versions with a single CLI command or click.
  You can also publish preview-versions and test them before switching them to active.
- **Custom domains with automatic SSL**: <br/>
  You can configure custom domains and subdomains for your applications.
  SSL certificates will automatically be provisioned and renewed for you.
- **Remote Sessions**: <br/>
  Interactive remote shell environments, via [`wasmer ssh`](/edge/learn/remote-sessions).
- **SSH Server Configuration**: <br/>
  Configure SSH servers directly within your applications with custom user authentication, passwords, and SSH key support.

### üõ†Ô∏è Features in Development

- **Persistent workloads**: <br />
  Apps are stateless and auto-scaled by default, which is great for scalability
  and cost-effectiveness, but sometimes you need to run a persistent workload
  that keep running, even with no requests coming in.<br />
  Persistent workloads will enable you to provision a fixed number of instances
  that are kept alive by the edge runtime.

- **Persistent volumes**: <br />
  Stateless apps are great for scalability, but eventually the state needs to
  live somewhere.
  You will be able to create persistent volumes, and mount these volumes into
  your workloads.

- **Private network**: <br />
  Create secure, private networks to connect your workloads globally.
  Powered by [DNET](/edge/architecture#wasmer-distributed-networking-dnet);

- **Scheduled tasks / cronjobs**: <br />
  Running tasks at a certain interval is a common requirement.
  You will be able to configure scheduled invocation of your apps at a given interval.
  The web UI and CLI will allow inspecting logs and success status of the task runs.
