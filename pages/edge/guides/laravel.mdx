Getting an application running on Wasmer Edge is essentially working out how to package it as a deployable image.
Once packaged, it can be deployed to the [Wasmer Edge](https://wasmer.io/products/edge) platform.

In this guide we'll learn how to deploy a Laravel application on Wasmer Edge.
You can also set up a new app easily with one of the [Laravel templates on Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/templates).

### Prerequisites

* PHP 8.2+ - See instructions [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
* composer - See instructions [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Prepare a Laravel app

Bring your own Laravel app, or create a new one!

```bash copy
composer create-project laravel/laravel wasmer-edge-laravel
cd wasmer-edge-laravel
php artisan serve
```

You should be able to visit http://localhost:8000 and see the home page.

## Deploy to Wasmer Edge 

<Steps>

<Install />

<Login />

### Setup a Wasmer Package

Now, lets make your app run with Wasmer. For that, you'll need to create a `wasmer.toml` file.
You can simply use this configuration:

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" copy
[dependencies]
"php/php" = "=8.3.4"

[fs]
"/app/" = "."

[[command]]
name = "run"
module = "php/php:php"
runner = "wasi"
[command.annotations.wasi]
main-args = ["-t", "/app/public", "-S", "localhost:8080"]
```

You can test that the app works properly with Wasmer by running in your shell:

```bash copy
wasmer run .
```

And then visiting http://localhost:8080/

Once you verify that everything is running well, you should be ready to deploy to Wasmer Edge!

### Custom PHP settings

Please check [Wasmer PHP guide](/edge/guides/php#custom-php-settings) if you want to customize PHP settings for your app.

### Deploy

Now, simply run `wasmer deploy` and that will guide you to depoloying the app.

In case you have any secrets or environment variables you want to set up, you can set secrets with the `wasmer app secrets` command:

```bash copy
wasmer app secrets create SOME_SECRET_KEY SOME_VALUE
```

</Steps>


## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your PHP Laravel application on Wasmer Edge 🚀.

> Tip: To make redeploy, simply run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
