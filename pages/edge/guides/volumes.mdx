# Using persistent storage in Wasmer Edge Apps

In this tutorial, you will learn how to setup persistent storage for your edge apps

Let's start with creating an edge application

You can quickstart with an application from one of our templates
```bash copy
wasmer app create --template static-website
```

Now, let's edit `app.yaml` to setup persistent volume

Add
```yaml copy
volumes:
  - name: data
    mount: /public/things_i_want_to_persist
```
to `app.yaml`. This will mount a persistent volume named `data` into `/public/persistent_volume` directory of your application

Now, let's re-deploy the app

```bash
wasmer deploy
```

After deployment completes, you can open your app's dashboard, printed in the deployment status: `-> Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/...`.
To see the persistent volume under the storage tab (e.g. https://wasmer.io/apps/{username}/{appname}/storage).
All the data that your application creates under the mounted directory will persist through app crashes, restarts and updates. 
The volumes are also s3 compatible.
You can use any s3 client to retrieve and upload data to your bucket


# Accessing volume from outside of your app

<ImageLoader
  img={dashboard}
  alt={"app dashboard"}
  className="bg-[#111111] rounded-lg p-4 dark:bg-transparent"
/>

## via s3 clients
You can provide the credentials specific to your app to any s3 client for accessing your volume. The credentials are available in your app's dashboard

Also, wasmer cli has a convenient way to configure rclone. `wasmer app volume configure` will print rclone configuration for connecting your apps volume

## via wasmer.io
In the storage section of your app's dashboard, you can see links to browse your volumes. 

Clicking browse volumes will redirect and authenticate you to an S3 frontend to view your content of your volume
Note: You can only view, you can't upload files with the s3 frontend yet. 

# Proving persistency

Now, let's upload "hello world" file to the volume. Get your volumes credentials and upload using an s3 client
```bash
echo "Hello World!" > index.html
rclone copy ./index.html edge-volume:/data
```
(`/data` is the name of the volume, since you can mount multiple volumes to your app, you access to your data under via rclone in /\{volume_name\})
The template app we used will show the file you uploaded at https://your_app_url.wasmer.app/things_i_want_to_persist/index.html
You can also use the s3 client or the s3 frontend that we host for you to view your uploaded file

Now, let's force a container restart.
When updating your app with `wasmer deploy`, a new instance of your app will be created. So a new filesystem will be in use for your app and the volumes will be mounted
After running `wasmer deploy`, you can see your `index.html` is still there. View from the app at url https://your_app_url.wasmer.app/things_i_want_to_persist/index.html, or from your s3 client, or from our hosted s3 frontend!
