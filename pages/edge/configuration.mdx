# App Configuration (`app.yaml`)

Wasmer Edge's configuration is stored in a `app.yaml` file in the root of your project.

## Example

```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
# Required fields

kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
# username or namespace that owns the app
owner: my-account
# App name
name: my-sample-site
# Package to run (it can also be `.`)
package: wasmer/my-sample-site

# OPTIONAL fields

# Enable debug mode
# If true, http responses will have more detailed error information.
debug: true

# Environment variables
env:
  MY_VAR: "my-value123"

# CLI arguments passed to the binary
cli_args:
  - arg1
  - arg2

capabilities:
  # Fast startup with instaboot
  instaboot:
    requests:
      - path: /
      - path: /_bootstrap
```

## Fields

Detailed description of all available fields.

### `kind`

The `kind` field is used to identify the type of configuration file. It is required and is a constant set to `wasmer.io/App.v0`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This constant field might be used in the future to support multiple
  configuration formats.
</Callout>

### `name`

The `name` field is used to identify the name of the application. It is **required** and must be unique.

- Required: `true`
- Required format: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`

### `description`

The `description` field is used to provide a description of the application. It is **optional** and can be any string.

- Required: `false`

### `package`

The `package` field is used to specify the name of the package to deploy.
It is **required** and must specify a package published to the Wasmer registry.

Note: if you have a wasmer.toml in the same directory as the `app.yaml`, `wasmer deploy` will automatically prompt you to publish a new version of the package.

- Required: `true`

### `env`

Specify environment variables for the app.
Must be a key-value map.

Example:
```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
env:
  MY_VAR: "my-value123"
```

- Required: `false`

### `cli_args`

Specify command line arguments passed to the application.

Example:
```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
cli_args:
  - arg1
  - arg2
```

- Required: `false`

### `debug`

The `debug` field is used to enable debug mode for the application. This in turn will show detailed error messages if a request fails, instead of a generic error. It is **optional** and can be any boolean.

- Required: `false`
- Default: `false`

### `capabilities`

#### `instaboot`

Enable fast application startup with startup snapshots.

See [InstaBoot](/edge/learn/instaboot) for more details.

```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
capabilities:
  instaboot:
    requests:
      - path: /
      - path: /_bootstrap
        # You can optionally speciy a maximum age.
        # If the maximum age is reached, a new snapshot will automatically
        # be created, and the old ones discarded
        max_age: 12h

        # Optionally request settings:
        method: POST
	body: "custom body"
	headers:
	- name: X-My-Header
	  value: my-value
```

### `health_checks`

The `health_checks` field is used to check if an application is working correctly. If the healthchecks fail, edge will restart the application. It is **optional** and its an array of healtcheck objects

- Required: `false`

Currently only supported healthcheck type is `http`. It executes an http request against the application. All the supported 

##### Example healthcheck

```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
health_checks:
  - http:
      method: get
      path: /
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      unhealthy_threshold: 2
      healthy_threshold: 1
      expected_status_codes:
        - 200
      # below are optional
      expected_body_includes: Hello World
      expected_body_regex: ".*Wasmer.*"
```
Fields for http healthcheck:
- #### `method`: Required
  HTTP method to use. 
- #### `path`: Required
  Path to send request to. 
- #### `interval`: Required
  Duration between each request
- #### `timeout`: Required
  Timeout duration for requests
- #### `unhealthy_threshold`: Required
  After `unhealthy_threshold` amount of failure of the http requests, app is considered unhealthy and will be restarted
- #### `healthy_threshold`: Required
  After `healthy_threshold` amount of failure of the http requests, app is considered healthy and will be restarted
- #### `expected_status_codes`: Required
  If the application returns these status codes, then the request will be count as successful
- #### `expected_body_includes`:
  If this is specified, response body should include the string defined in this field to be count as successful
- #### `expected_body_regex`:
  If this is specified, response body should be able to match the regular expression defined in this field to be count as successful

So in the example above, if the application fails two consequent request, application will be restarted. It will be keep restarted until it successfully responds to one request

### `scaling`

The `scaling` field is used to configure how your application scales on Edge.

#### `scaling.mode`

Scaling mode for the app.

**NOTE**: You should usually stick to the default behaviour,
which is enabled when no scaling mode is specified.
Only use the below modes if you you are sure they are appropriate!

Available values:

* `<unset>`

  If no scaling mode is specified, Edge will send multiple requests to each instance, and also scale up additional instances if required.
  This is the default, and the recommended mode if your program can handle multiple requests concurrently (Rust, Go, ...).

* `single_concurrency`

  Special scaling mode for apps that only support **a single request at a time**.
  You should enable this mode if your app can not handle multiple requests concurrently.

  Only a single request will be sent to each instance at a time.
  Edge will dynamically scale up additional instances of your app as required by the incoming request volume, and shut them down when they are no longer needed.
  This mode is appropriate for single-threaded synchronous Python/PHP/Ruby/...

Example:
```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
scaling:
  mode: single_concurrency
```

- Required: `false`
