# Quickstart guide for a static website

In this quickstart guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a static site on Wasmer Edge.
We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new static site, and deploying it.

## Deploying a static site

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Initialize the local directory 

<Callout type="default" emoji="⚛">
  If you want to deploy a static site made from frameworks like React, Vue, or
  Svelte, you can follow our [React Static
  Site](/edge/guides/react-static-site) tutorial.
</Callout>

With the CLI installed, let's create a new static site! We begin 
creating a new empty directory - after that, we will need to run a single command. 

```bash
$ mkdir my-new-site
$ cd my-new-site
$ wasmer deploy --template=static-website             
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
✔ Who should own this app? · <you> 
✔ What should be the name of the app? · <your-app-name> 
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

The `wasmer deploy --template=static-website` command will prompt you for the following:

- **App owner**: This is the owner of the app. It can be your username
  or an organization; if you're logged in, the command will prompt you to
  choose from your namespaces: by default, it will be your username.
- **App name**: This is the name of your app. By default, it will be the name
  of the current directory. 

The above command will do the following:

- Download the template from the registry 
- Deploy it to Wasmer Edge with the user-provided informations

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  Don't change the `public` directory attribute in the `wasmer.toml` file for
  this tutorial. If you want to learn how to specify a different directory for
  build output, check out our [React Static
  Site](/edge/guides/react-static-site) tutorial.
</Callout>

This is what the static website looks like in a browser:

<StaticSite image={staticSiteImg} />

### Update the app 

Your directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="my-new-site" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="LICENSE" />
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
	<FileTree.Folder name="public" defaultOpen>
  	  <FileTree.File name="index.html" />
  	</FileTree.Folder>
  	<FileTree.Folder name="settings" defaultOpen>
  	  <FileTree.File name="config.toml" />
  	</FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>


To illustrate the lifecycle of an app, let's edit the `index.html` file 
in the `public` folder: 

```shell
$ pwd
.../my-new-site
$ sed -i -e 's/Hi from the Edge/This is our new title!/g' public/index.html 
$ wasmer deploy
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

### Add your content

Currently, the public directory only contains a basic `index.html` file.

You can now modify this directory and copy your own files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc)
as needed.

### Test your site locally 

You can also test your site locally before deploying the app on Wasmer Edge by
running the following command:

```shell copy
wasmer run .
```

This will start a local server using the Static Web Server on
`http://localhost:80`. You can also specify a different port by passing the
`--port` flag, as in `wasmer run . -- --port=<your-port>`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The arguments after `--` (double dash) are passed to the underlying server running in the
  Wasmer runtime.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click
  [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation. To see all the avilable
  options for the static web server, run `wasmer run . -- --help`.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a static site on Wasmer Edge 🚀.

> Tip: To make changes to your site, simply modify the files in the public
> directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
