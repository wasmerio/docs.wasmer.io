# Troubleshooting Common Problems

This page contains several common problems that may be encountered while using
the `@wasmer/sdk` package.

## `SharedArrayBuffer` and Cross-Origin Isolation

If you encounter the following warning in your console while using the
`@wasmer/sdk` package, it indicates an issue with Cross-Origin Isolation:

```
WARN wasmer_js::tasks::scheduler: An error occurred while handling a message
    error=Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'Worker': SharedArrayBuffer transfer
          requires self.crossOriginIsolated.
```

### Root Cause

This issue arises due to security measures implemented in browsers following the
Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. These measures restrict the sharing of
`SharedArrayBuffer` objects with Web Workers unless the execution context is
deemed secure.

The `@wasmer/sdk` uses a threadpool built on Web Workers and requires sharing
the same `SharedArrayBuffer` across multiple workers to enable WASIX threads to
access the same address space. This requirement is crucial even for running
single-threaded WASIX programs because the SDK internals rely on
`SharedArrayBuffer` for communication with Web Workers.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, your application must run in a secure context with
Cross-Origin Isolation. This is achieved by setting specific HTTP response
headers:

1. **Set 'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy' to 'same-origin'**: This header ensures
  that your document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin
  documents.
2. **Set 'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy' to 'require-corp'**: This header
  requires all resources to be loaded with explicit CORS policies, enabling a
  secure environment for `SharedArrayBuffer`.

After setting these headers, reload your application and verify if the issue is
resolved.

## Instantiation Failed Due to Memory Import Mismatch

If you encounter an error message similar to the one below when running
WebAssembly modules with the `@wasmer/sdk`, it indicates an issue with memory
imports:

```
ERROR wasmer_wasix::state::env: Instantiation failed
    pid=1
    error=RuntimeError: js: WebAssembly.Instance():
        Import #54 module="env" function="memory":
        memory import has 1 page which is smaller than the declared initial of 179
```

This error typically appears when attempting to run a package like `ffmpeg` in
the following manner:

```typescript
import { init, Wasmer } from "@wasmer/sdk";

await init();

const pkg = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("wasmer/ffmpeg@1.0.5");
const ffmpeg = pkg.commands["ffmpeg"].binary();
const module = await WebAssembly.compile(ffmpeg);

let instance = await run(module, {
    program: "ffmpeg",
    args: ["-i", "input.mp4", "-vf", `"transpose=2"`, "output.mp4"],
});
let result = await instance.wait();
```

### Root Cause

The issue stems from how memory is allocated for the WebAssembly module. When
using `WebAssembly.compile()` and `run()` directly, the browser doesn't provide
detailed information about the memory requirements of the module, such as the
number of pages needed.

Wasmer has no way of knowing how much memory the WebAssembly module is importing
(the `env.memory` import), so [it guesses][guesses] a minimum of 1 page and
hopes for the best.

Most of the time this works out fine, but some WebAssembly modules (like
`ffmpeg`) are statically defined to require significantly more (in this case, at
least 179 pages).

### Solution

To work around this, Wasmer has [a `wasm-types-polyfill`
feature][wasm-types-polyfill], which parses the original `*.wasm` file to
determine the correct amount of memory required. To utilize this workaround, you
should pass the original `*.wasm` file's contents as a `Uint8Array` to the
`run()` method.

```typescript /ffmpeg,/
import { init, Wasmer } from "@wasmer/sdk";

await init();

const pkg = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("wasmer/ffmpeg@1.0.5");
const ffmpeg = pkg.commands["ffmpeg"].binary();

let instance = await run(ffmpeg, {
    program: "ffmpeg",
    args: ["-i", "input.mp4", "-vf", `"transpose=2"`, "output.mp4"],
});
let result = await instance.wait();
```

A more straightforward and effective approach is to use the package's
`entrypoint.run()` method, which automatically handles memory allocation
correctly.

Here is the recommended way to run a package's command:

```typescript
const pkg = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("ffmpeg/ffmpeg");
const instance = await pkg.entrypoint.run({ args: [...] });
const output = await instance.wait();
```

Using this approach ensures that the necessary memory is allocated for the
WebAssembly module, thereby avoiding the instantiation error.

## Undefined `__wbindgen_*` Reference

When working with the `@wasmer/sdk` package, you might encounter the following
JavaScript error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '__wbindgen_add_to_stack_pointer')
```

This error typically occurs when trying to access `@wasmer/sdk` functionalities
without properly initializing the SDK.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is the premature usage of the `@wasmer/sdk`
package's functions or methods before calling the `init()` function.

The `init()` function is crucial as it loads the WebAssembly code that
constitutes the core logic of the `@wasmer/sdk` and initializes internal states
necessary for the package, including those set up by
[`wasm-bindgen`][wasm-bindgen].

### Solution

To resolve this issue, ensure that `init()` is called and awaited at the
beginning of your script or module where you intend to use the `@wasmer/sdk`.

This setup should be done before any other interaction with the SDK's
functionalities.

```typescript
import { init, Wasmer } from "@wasmer/sdk";

async function main() {
  // Ensure to await the initialization before using any SDK functionality
  await init();

  // After initialization, you can safely use the SDK's features
  const pkg = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("some-package");
  // ... rest of your code
}

main();
```

## Unable to Determine Hardware Concurrency

When attempting to use the `@wasmer/sdk` package, you might encounter the
following error:

```
Error: Unable to determine the hardware concurrency
    at A.wbg.__wbg_new_ab87fd305ed9004b (/path/to/node_modules/@wasmer/sdk/dist/Library.cjs:11:44038)
    ... [additional stack trace] ...
  detailedMessage: 'Unable to determine the hardware concurrency',
  causes: []
```

This error typically arises when executing `@wasmer/sdk` code within a Node.js
environment.

### Root Cause

The `@wasmer/sdk` package is currently designed for browser environments and
relies on specific browser features.

The error is caused by the absence of the `navigator` object in Node.js, which
`@wasmer/sdk` attempts to access to determine the hardware concurrency level
(specifically, `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`). Since Node.js doesn't provide
this browser-specific object, the SDK cannot function as expected.

<Callout type="warning">
  This is the first of several places where `@wasmer/sdk` is not yet compatible
  with Node.js.

  A future release of Node.js with
  [nodejs/node#47769](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/47769) may resolve the
  `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` issue only for `@wasmer/sdk` to fail at
  another place where Node.js diverges from web APIs.
</Callout>

### Solution

As of now, `@wasmer/sdk` does not support Node.js.

To resolve this issue, you need to run your code in a supported browser
environment rather than in Node.js.
