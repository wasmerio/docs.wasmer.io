# Quickstart guide for a JS service worker

In this guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a JS service
worker on Wasmer Edge. We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new
JavaScript worker, and deploying it.

## Deploying a JS service worker

<Steps>

<Install />

<Login />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Deploy!
We begin creating a new empty directory.
```bash copy
mkdir my-new-js-worker
cd my-new-js-worker
```

Then, running a single command, we can set up a JS worker:

```bash copy
wasmer deploy --template=js-worker
```
This will prompt you for the following:

- **App owner**: This is the owner of the app.
It can be your username or an organization; if you're logged in, the command will prompt you to choose from your namespaces: by default, it will be your username.
- **App name**: This is the name of your app. By default, it will be the name of the current directory. 

Expect to see output similar to this:
```bash
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
✔ Who should own this app? · wasmer-user
✔ What should be the name of the app? · jsworker
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes
Loading local package (manifest path: ~/wasmer-user/Projects/jsworker/.)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Successfully pushed release to namespace wasmer-user on the registry
Deploying app jsworker (wasmer-user) to Wasmer Edge...

App jsworker (wasmer-user) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://jsworker-wasmer-user.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://48xhpiqcq3mg.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/wasmer-user/jsworker

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

The above command will do the following:

- Download the template from the registry 
- Deploy it to Wasmer Edge with the user-provided information

Let's check it: 
```bash copy
curl https://jsworker-wasmer-user.wasmer.app
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
    The deployment URL follows the format `https://<app-name>-<app-owner>.wasmer.app`
</Callout>

Expect output similar to:
```bash
{
  "env": {
    ...
  },
  "headers": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Update the app 
Your directory should now look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.js" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
</FileTree>



To illustrate the lifecycle of an app, let's edit the `index.js` file 
in the `public` folder: 

```js copy filename="src/index.js"
async function handler(request) {
  const out = JSON.stringify({
    env: process.env,
    headers: Object.fromEntries(request.headers),
    hello: "world", // 👈 Add this
  }, null, 2);
  return new Response(out, {
    headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  });
}

addEventListener("fetch", (fetchEvent) => {
  fetchEvent.respondWith(handler(fetchEvent.request));
}
```

Now, simply run `wasmer deploy` again:
```bash copy
wasmer deploy
```

Wait for the deployment to be ready, then check it again:
```bash copy
curl https://jsworker-wasmer-user.wasmer.app
```

Expect output:
```bash
{
  "env": {
    ...
  },
  "headers": {
    ...
  },
  "hello": "world"
}
```

### Testing your JS service worker locally

To run your worker locally, simply run

```bash copy
wasmer run .
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation. 
</Callout>

The above command will start a web server on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Let's try to cURL the server:

```bash copy
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Expect:
```bash
{
  "env": {
    ...
  },
  "headers": {
    ...
  },
  "hello": "world"
}
```

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a JS service worker on Wasmer Edge 🚀.

> Tip: To make changes to your JS service worker, simply modify the `index.js` file in the
> `src` directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.

### Following up
Try running:
```bash copy
time curl -o /dev/null -s -w '%{time_total}\n' https://<app-name>-<your-user>.wasmer.app
```

Note how the cold-start isn't so cold! 🔥
