# How to create a Runner

Runners allow anyone to create custom ways to run Wasmer packages / WebAssembly modules.

This can be incredibly useful for different use cases:
* You are a game creator such as [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org/), or others, and you want to create a custom runner so your games can be published and run with Wasmer.
* You have created a new ABI for using, for example, WebGPU in the server and the browser and you want to allow those programs to be published and run with Wasmer.

Other use cases?
