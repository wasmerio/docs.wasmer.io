# Quickstart guide for a PHP application

In this guide, you'll learn the process of deploying a PHPapplication on Wasmer Edge.
We will cover installation of the CLI, setting up a new PHP application, and deploying it.

## Deploying a PHP application 

<Steps>

<Install />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Initialize the local directory 

With the CLI installed, let's create a new PHP application! We begin 
creating a new empty directory - after that, we will need to run a single command. 

```bash
$ mkdir my-php-application 
$ cd my-php-application
$ wasmer deploy --template=php-starter
It seems you are trying to create a new app!
✔ Who should own this app? · <you> 
✔ What should be the name of the app? · <your-app-name> 
✔ Unpacked template
✔ Do you want to deploy the app now? · yes
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

The `wasmer deploy --template=php-starter` command will prompt you for the following:

- **App owner**: This is the owner of the package. It can be your username
  or an organization; if you're logged in, the command will prompt you to
  choose from your namespaces: by default, it will be your username.
- **App name**: This is the name of your app. By default, it will be the name
  of the current directory. 

The above command will do the following:

- Download the template from the registry 
- Deploy it to Wasmer Edge with the user-provided informations

Let's check it: 
```shell
$ curl https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
1	=>	PHP code tester Sandbox Online
emoji	=>	😀 😃 😄 😁 😆
2	=>	5
5	=>	89009
Random number	=>	<random!>
PHP Version	=>	8.3.4
```

### Update the app 

Your directory should now look like this:


<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.php" />
    <FileTree.File name="info.php" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
  <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
  <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
</FileTree>

To illustrate the lifecycle of an app, let's edit the `index.php` file 
in the `app` folder: 

```php copy filename="app/index.php"
<?php
// Enter your code here, enjoy!
$array = array("1" => "PHP code tester Sandbox Online",
    "emoji" => "😀 😃 😄 😁 😆", 5 , 5 => 89009,
    "Random number" => rand(100,999),
    "PHP Version" => phpversion(), 	// <- Notice the comma! 
	"Hello" => "World" 	// <- New line 
);

foreach( $array as $key => $value ){
    echo $key."\t=>\t".$value."\n";
}
```

Now, simply run `wasmer deploy` again:

```shell
$ wasmer deploy
Loading local package (manifest path: <current-working-directory>)
✔ Correctly built package locally
✔ Package correctly uploaded
✔ Succesfully pushed release to namespace <you> on the registry 
Deploying app <your-app-name> (<you>) to Wasmer Edge...

App <your-app-name> (<you>) was successfully deployed 🚀
https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app

→ Unique URL: https://<app_id>.id.wasmer.app
→ Dashboard:  https://wasmer.io/apps/<you>/<your-app-name>

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
𖥔 Deployment complete
```

Let's check it again:
```shell
$ curl https://<your-app-name>-<you>.wasmer.app
1	=>	PHP code tester Sandbox Online
emoji	=>	😀 😃 😄 😁 😆
2	=>	5
5	=>	89009
Random number	=>	286
PHP Version	=>	8.3.4
Hello	=>	World
```

### Testing your PHP application locally
To test your PHP application locally simply run

```shell copy
$ wasmer run . --net 
Starting server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
````

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  You can see all the available options with `wasmer run --help` or click
  [here](/runtime/cli/) to see the full documentation. 
</Callout>


Let's try to cURL the server:

```shell copy
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000
1	=>	PHP code tester Sandbox Online
emoji	=>	😀 😃 😄 😁 😆
2	=>	5
5	=>	89009
Random number	=>	286
PHP Version	=>	8.3.4
Hello	=>	World
```

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a PHP application on Wasmer Edge 🚀.

> Tip: To make changes to your PHP application, simply modify the `index.php` file
> in the `app` directory and run `wasmer deploy` again to deploy the changes.
