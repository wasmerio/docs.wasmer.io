# SSH / SFTP Configuration

<CalloutProFeature />

SSH and SFTP access for Wasmer Edge apps support both password and public key
authentication.

This feature is disabled by default and must be enabled manually for each app.

## Configuration in the Web UI

To enable SSH/SFTP access for your Edge app in the web UI:

* Open your dashboard on [wasmer.io](https://wasmer.io)
* Open your app
* Go to the **Settings** tab
* Open the **SFTP/SSH** panel
* Click *Enable*

You will now see your user/password access credentials
and will be able to manage authorized SSH public keys.

## Configuration in app.yaml

If you deploy your app with an `app.yaml` configuration, you can enable SSH/SFTP access
there as well.

See [the configuration schema](/edge/configuration#ssh) for a detailed
description of the configuration schema.

**Note**: There is a small gotcha:
The SSH username must be prefixed with the app short id, which is only available
after the initial deployment. See below for how to retrieve the id.

Here is an example `app.yaml` configuration enabling SSH access:

```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
capabilities:
  ssh:
    enabled: true
    users:
      - username: <app-id>_admin
        passwords:
          - type: plain
            password: "my-secure-password"
        authorized_keys:
          - "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ..."
...

### Retrieving the app short id

To retrieve the app short id, you can use the Wasmer CLI:

```bash
wasmer app info <your-app-name> --json | jq -r .id

...
...
Unique URL: https://19hninc0dpgd.id.wasmer.app
...
```

The short id is the first part of the unique URL, in this case `19hninc0dpgd`.

Use this id to prefix your SSH usernames in the `app.yaml` file.
