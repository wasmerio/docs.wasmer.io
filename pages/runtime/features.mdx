# Wasmer Runtime Features

Wasmer is powered by [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).

Wasmer supports many different backends, depending on your needs:
* Wasmer Native Backends:
  - _Singlepass_: incredibly fast compilation times, ideal for Blockchain [Smart Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract)
  - _Cranelift_: normal compilation times, good performance
  - _LLVM_: slow compilation times, great performance
* Other Runtimes:
  - _V8_: ideal for iOS, Android and development.
  - _Wasmi_: ideal for iOS, or any environment where only interpreters can run.
  - _JavascriptCore_: ideal for macOS. See [announcement](https://wasmer.io/posts/wasmer-3_3-and-javascriptcore)
  - _Browser_: to target the web

Each of this backends support different features, and have different support for Operating Systems and Chipsets.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important Licensing Information**: The Singlepass and LLVM compiler backends are now licensed under the Business Source License (BUSL-1.1). Production use of these backends requires being a Sponsor under the Wasmer Sponsorship Program or an entity within the Sponsorship Network of a current Sponsor. For more information about the Wasmer Sponsorship Program, please contact licensing@wasmer.io.

## Licensing

Wasmer backends are available under different licenses:

- **Cranelift**: Available under an open-source license for all uses including production.
- **Singlepass**: Available under the Business Source License (BUSL-1.1), which restricts production use to Sponsors under the Wasmer Sponsorship Program.
- **LLVM**: Available under the Business Source License (BUSL-1.1), which restricts production use to Sponsors under the Wasmer Sponsorship Program.

### WebAssembly Features

  - **Bulk-memory operations**: e.g. instructions with behavior similar to C's `memmove` and `memset` in WebAssembly;
  - **Multi-value return**: return multiple values from functions making data transfer between host and guest simpler;
  - **Import & export of mutable globals**: adds ability to import and export mutable globals;
  - **Non-trapping float-to-int conversions**: this proposal would establish a convention for saturating operations, to avoid introducing trapping;
  - **Sign-extension operations**: adds five new integer instructions for sign-extending 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit values;
  - **Reference types**: easier and more efficient interop with host environment;
  - **SIMD**: Single Instruction, Multiple data: do heavy number crunching more quickly and/or with lower power usage.
  - **Threads**: adds a new shared linear memory type and some new operations for atomic memory access;

### Wasmer features
  - **Caching**: compiled WebAssembly modules can be reused so subsequent runs of a Wasm file will have very little start up time;
  - **Metering**: computation time and other resources can be monitored and limits set to control how the Wasm code runs. This is also known as "gas metering";
