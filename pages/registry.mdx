# Wasmer Registry

The Wasmer Registry stores all Wasmer packages and allows exploring packages from other users and distribute your own ones.

You can explore packages published to the Wasmer Registry at [wasmer.io](https://wasmer.io/explore) or you can
also [search for packages](https://wasmer.io/search?type=PACKAGE).

## üê• First Steps

To publish your first package, check out the [Getting Started](/registry/get-started/) guide.

## Features

All packages published to the Wasmer registry will automatically be available to run with the `wasmer` CLI tool, but not just that...

- **Executables**: The registry will automatically create executables for all platforms and chipsets, with no dependency of Wasmer
- **Automatic documentation**: If you annotate your package with bindings, the documentation and APIs will be automatically generated for all programming languages.
