# Accessing your Wasmer Apps over SSH

<CalloutProFeature />

You can access your Wasmer Edge applications over SSH.

This can be useful for:

* Modifying files in volumes
* Running maintenance commands on your app (such as migrations)
* Creating a backup of your application
* ...

**Note**: This works a bit differently from SSH access to traditional/regular servers.
Read more below.

To enable SSH access, you need to enable it in your app settings.
Follow the [configuration documentation](./configuration) for details.

## SSH Environment

Unlike traditional hosting providers, SSH sessions for Wasmer Edge apps run
in an isolated container environment, distinct from the containers serving
your application traffic.

The environment is very similar to the one your application runs in, which means:
* All your configured secrets and environment variables are available
* Your application files are present on the file system
* Your volumes are mounted and accessible

## wasmer CLI

The recommended way to use SSH is through the wasmer CLI.

It provides a convenient command to open an SSH session to your app, which
uses short-lived token authentication under the hood, so you don't have to
worry about credentials.

```bash
wasmer ssh --app <your-app-name>
```

## Credentials

If you prefer to use traditional user/password or public key authentication,
first configure SSH access by following the [configuration documentation](./documentation).

Then, you can copy and paste the URL and credentials from the dashboard.

If you configured through app.yaml:
* Always use the app URL as the `@<host>`
* The port is always the default SSH port `22`

Example:

```bash
ssh <my-configured-username>@my-app.wasmer.app
```
