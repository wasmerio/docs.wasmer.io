# CGI apps on Wasmer Edge

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a CGI app on Wasmer Edge. We will
be using the Rust's [CGI crate](https://crates.io/crates/cgi) to create a CGI app.

We'll just make a simple `Hello, World!` CGI app.

## What is CGI?

CGI or Common Gateway Interface is a standard for running programs on a web server
to generate dynamic content.
CGI programs are often written in scripting languages like Perl, Python, or Ruby,
but they can also be written in compiled languages like C, C++, or Rust.

### CGI with Wasmer

CGI works using the standard input and output streams. Wasmer maps the standard
input and output streams to the HTTP request and response. You can read more about WCGI
in our article, [Announcing WCGI](https://docs.wasmer.io/runtime/runners/wcgi).

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Creating a CGI app

<Steps>

<Install />

<Login />

<CliVersionCallout />

### Install the `wasm32-wasi` target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

This will install the `wasm32-wasi` target for the Rust compiler.

### Initialize the project

We'll initialize an empty rust project using the `cargo` command-line tool.

```bash
cargo init --bin hello-cgi
```

### Add the CGI crate

```bash
cargo add cgi
```

### Writing the CGI app

We'll write a simple CGI app that prints `Hello, World!` to the standard output.
This app also accepts a name as a body of the request and prints `Hello, {name}!`

> **Note:** This cgi app will be wired to WCGI and will be served on the root path.

```rust copy filename="src/main.rs"
use cgi::{http::StatusCode, Request, Response};

fn main() {
    cgi::handle(handler);
}

fn handler(request: Request) -> Response {
    let who = String::from_utf8_lossy(request.body());
    let who = if who.trim().is_empty() {
        "World"
    } else {
        who.trim()
    };

    cgi::text_response(StatusCode::OK, format!("Hello, {who}!"))
}

```

### Wiring it up with WCGI

Let's create a `wasmer.toml` file in the root of the project. For integrating with WCGI,
we'll use the `wcgi` runner from Wasmer to run our CGI app.This wiring up is done
automatically by the wasmer runtime and we just need to specify the runner.

```bash
touch wasmer.toml
```

```toml copy filename="Cargo.toml"
[package]
name = "<your-namespace>/<your-package-name>"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "An application sample for WCGI"
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

[[module]]
name = "server"
source = "target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello-cgi.wasm"
abi = "wasi"

[[command]]
name = "server"
module = "server"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wcgi" # üëàüèº This is the runner we'll be using

[command.annotations.wasi]
env = ["SCRIPT_NAME=rust_wcgi"] # This hack is required for now

[command.annotations.wcgi]
dialect = "rfc-3875" # This is the CGI dialect we'll be using
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  <ol>
    <li>
      1. `your-namespace`: This is usually your username and also can be your
      organization name.
    </li>
    <li>
      2. `your-package-name`: This is the name of your package that'll be
      published to the wasmer-registry.
    </li>
  </ol>
</Callout>

### Building the CGI app

As you see above in the source property, in the `module` section. We use the release build in wasm32-wasi target.

```bash copy
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
```

This will create a `hello-cgi.wasm` file in the `target/wasm32-wasi/release` directory.

### Running the CGI app

Now we can test our CGI app locally using the `wasmer` command-line.

```bash copy
wasmer run . --net
```

The above command will start a local server on port `8000`.

To test the app, we can use `curl` to send a request to the server.

```bash copy
curl http://localhost:8000
```

```console
Hello, World!
```

The root path will return `Hello, World!` as we didn't specify any name in the body.

We can also send a `POST` request with a body to the server.

```bash copy
curl -X POST -d "Wasmer" http://localhost:8000
```

The above command will send a `POST` request with the body `Wasmer` to the server.

```console
Hello, Wasmer!
```

### Deploying the CGI app

For this we need to create a `app.yaml` in the root of the project.

```yaml copy filename="app.yaml"
---
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
name: <your-app-name> # üëàüèº This is the name of your app
package: <your-namespace>/<your-package-name> # üëàüèº This is the name of your package that you set above
```

This would be the final directory structure that you'll see:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="your-top-level-dir" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="main.rs" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="app.yaml" />
    <FileTree.File name="wasmer.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Now write the following command to deploy the app.

```bash copy
wasmer deploy
```

```console
Loaded app from: /Volumes/Work/Projects/wasmer-edge/wcgi-rust-template/app.yaml

Publish new version of package '<your-namespace>/<your-package-name>'? yes # üëàüèº choose yes here
Publishing package...
[1/2] ‚¨ÜÔ∏è   Uploading...

Deploying app <your-app-name>...

 ‚úÖ App <your-namespace>/<your-app-name> was successfully deployed!

> App URL: https://wasmer-wcgi-rust-template.wasmer.app # üëàüèº This is the URL of our app

> Admin dashboard: https://wasmer.io/apps/wasmer-wcgi-rust-template

Waiting for new deployment to become available...
(You can safely stop waiting now with CTRL-C)
.
New version is now reachable at https://wasmer-wcgi-rust-template.wasmer.app
Deployment complete
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  And now you can view your Static files at the URL mentioned above. You can
  also view the admin dashboard of your CDN by visiting the URL mentioned above.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="üåê">
  You'll need to do `wasmer deploy` again if you add any new files to the
  `public` directory.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="üöß">
  The url of your project will be different from the one mentioned above.
</Callout>

### Testing the deployed app

We can test the deployed app using `curl`.

```bash copy
curl https://wasmer-wcgi-rust-template.wasmer.app
```

```console
Hello, World!
```

Works as expected!
