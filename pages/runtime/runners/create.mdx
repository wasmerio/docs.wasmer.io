# How to create a Runner

Runners allow anyone to create custom ways to run Wasmer packages or WebAssembly modules.

This can be incredibly useful for different use cases:
* You are a game creator, such as [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org/), and you want to create a custom runner so your games can be published and run with Wasmer.
* You have created a new [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) for using, for example, WebGPU on the server and in the browser, and you want to allow those programs to be published and run with Wasmer.

Other use cases?
