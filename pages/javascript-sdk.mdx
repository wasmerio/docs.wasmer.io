# The Wasmer JavaScript SDK

The `@wasmer/sdk` package is Wasmer's SDK for JavaScript.

Some functionality supported by `@wasmer/sdk`:

- Executing WebAssembly modules compiled to [WASIX][wasix]
- Includes **full** WASI support (filesystem access, environment variables,
  command-line arguments, etc.)
- Running packages from [the Wasmer registry](/registry)
- Mounting directories into a WASIX instance and communicating with it while the
  instance is running
- Running multi-threaded WASIX programs
- Spawning sub-processes using commands from the same package, side-loaded
  packages (`uses`), or arbitrary packages from the Wasmer registry using the
  virtual `wasmer run` command

## Quickstart

First, add the [`@wasmer/sdk`][wasmer-sdk] to your project.

import { Tabs, Tab } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```sh copy
        npm install -S @wasmer/sdk
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```sh copy
        yarn add @wasmer/sdk
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```sh copy
        pnpm add @wasmer/sdk
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

We'll be running version `3.12` of the `python/python`

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="index.ts"
import { init, Wasmer } from "@wasmer/sdk";

await init();

const pkg = await Wasmer.fromRegistry("python/python@3.12");
const instance = await pkg.entrypoint.run({
    args: ["-c", "print('Hello, World!')"],
});

const { code, stdoutUtf8 } = await instance.wait();
console.log(`Python exited with ${code}: ${stdoutUtf8}`);
```

Breaking this down line-by-line...

Line 1 - imports the `Wasmer` class and `init()` function from the `@wasmer/sdk`
package.

Line 3 - here, the `init()` function is called and awaited. This function must
be called once before using any functionality from `@wasmer/sdk` It sets up the
necessary environment for running WebAssembly modules and instantiates the
WebAssembly runtime.

Line 5 - uses `Wasmer.fromRegistry()` to fetch the `python/python@3.12` package
from the Wasmer registry and load it into memory, alongside any dependencies it
may have.

Line 6 - runs the `python/python@3.12` package's entrypoint (the `python`
command) with the arguments `-c "print('Hello, World!")` and gets an `Instance`
which can be used to communicate with the running process.

Line 10 - waits until the python interpreter has exited, then extracts the
`code` and `stdoutUtf8` values from the output so they can be printed to
the console on line 11.
