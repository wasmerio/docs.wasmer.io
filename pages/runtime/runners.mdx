# Wasmer Runners

Wasmer has a pluggable runner architecture.
Currently, Wasmer supports the following runners:

- [WASIX](/runtime/runners/wasix)
- [Emscripten](/runtime/runners/emscripten)
- [WCGI](/runtime/runners/wcgi)

## WASI Implementations

For WASI support, Wasmer provides multiple implementation options:

- **[WASIX](/runtime/runners/wasix)**: Full-featured WASI implementation with filesystem, networking, and threading
- **[wasmer-wasi-light](/runtime/wasi-light)**: Lightweight WASI implementation optimized for reactor-style usage with minimal overhead
