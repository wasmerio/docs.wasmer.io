# Wasmer Registry

The Wasmer Registry stores all Wasmer packages and allows exploring packages from other users and distributing your own.

You can explore packages published to the Wasmer Registry at [wasmer.io](https://wasmer.io/explore) or you can
also [search for packages](https://wasmer.io/search?type=PACKAGE).

## 🐥 First Steps

To publish your first package, check out the [Getting Started](/registry/get-started/) guide.

<Card icon={<PublishIcon />} title="Publish your first package" href="/registry/get-started" />
</Cards>

## Features

All packages published to the Wasmer registry are automatically available to run with the `wasmer` CLI tool, and more:

- **Executables**: The registry will automatically create executables for all platforms and chipsets, with no dependency on Wasmer
- **Automatic documentation**: If you annotate your package with bindings, the documentation and APIs will be automatically generated for all programming languages.
