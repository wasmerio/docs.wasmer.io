# Connecting your domain to Wasmer Edge

## Introduction

For any functional website/server, you need a domain name. This is the address that people will use to access your services.
For example, the domain name for this website is `wasmer.io` and the domain for our registry is `registry.wasmer.io`.

In this guide, we will show you how to connect your domain to Wasmer Edge.

## Subdomain

If you want to connect a subdomain(e.g. `blogs.wasmer.io`) to your app hosted on Wasmer Edge, you will need to create a CNAME record pointing to your app on wasmer edge.

```yaml
blogs.wasmer.io. 0 3600 IN CNAME wasmer-blogs.wasmer.app.
```

And it should be done! You can now access your app on `blogs.wasmer.io`.

## Root domain

Connecting a root domain is a bit more complicated than connecting a subdomain because you can't create a CNAME record for a root domain. But there are some providers that allow you to create a CNAME record for a root domain. If your provider doesn't allow you to do that, you can use a service like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to create a CNAME record for your root domain.

If you want to connect your root domain (e.g. `wasmer.io`), to your app hosted on Wasmer Edge
You will need to create two additional records:

    1. A CNAME record pointing to your app on wasmer edge.
    2. A TXT record with the value `cname: wasmer.sh.       cname:wasmer--wasmer-sh.wasmer.app."

```yaml
wasmer.io.              0       IN      CNAME   wasmer-website.wasmer.app
wasmer.io.              0       IN      TXT     "cname:wasmer-website.wasmer.app."
```

And it should work now. You can now access your app on `wasmer.io`.

Let's breakdown the configuration:

1. The first record is a CNAME record pointing to your app on wasmer edge.
2. The second record is a TXT record which Wasmer Edge uses to verify that you own the domain and it needs to connect to your app.

## Future improvements

We are working on making this process easier. We are planning to add features such as:

1. Adding custom edge nameservers to your domain.
2. Adding a DNS provider to wasmer edge, So you can manage your DNS records from wasmer edge.
3. Adding a field in `app.yaml` to specify the domain you want to connect to your app. (This would be the easiest way to connect your domain to your app on wasmer edge)
