# Jobs

## Introduction

The `jobs` section allows defining scheduled or event-driven tasks
that execute commands or make HTTP requests. Jobs can be useful for
running periodic maintenance tasks, executing background processes, or
ensuring essential workflows are automated.


## Job Structure

Each job consists of the following fields:

- **name** *(str, required)* – A unique name for the job.
- **trigger** *(str, required)* – Defines when the job should run.
  - This can be a cron expression (e.g., `'*/15 * * * *'` for every 15
  minutes).
  - It can also be `'post-deployment'` to run after deployment.
  - `'pre-deployment'` is currently not supported.
- **action** *(required)* – Specifies the task to run. More details
  in the [next section](#job-actions). A job can:
  - Run a command using `execute`.
  - Make an HTTP request using `fetch`.
- **retries** *(int, Optional)* – The maximum number of times the job
  should retry upon failure.
- **timeout** *(duration, Optional)* – The maximum time a job is
  allowed to run before timing out (e.g., `'10m'` for 10 minutes).
- **max_schedule_drift** *(duration, Optional)* – The maximum
  allowed delay before the job is considered late. (e.g., `'10m'` for
  10 minutes)

[here](#example-jobs-configuration).


## Job Actions

This section defines the `action` field in a job definition. There are
two types of actions for a job:

1. **Executing a command (`execute`)**

   Runs a CLI command with Optional environment variables.
   ```yaml
   action:
     execute:
       command: install-wp
       cli_args:
         - "--version"
         - "--help"
       env:
         LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG
         EXTRA_FLAGS: "--enable-feature-1 --enable-feature-2"
   ```
   - `command` *(str, Optional)* – The command to execute.
   - `cli_args` *(List[str], Optional)* – Arguments for the command.
   - `env` *(map, Optional)* – Environment variables.

2. **Making an HTTP request (`fetch`)**

   Sends an HTTP request to a specific endpoint.
   ```yaml
   action:
     fetch:
       path: /wp-cron.php
       timeout: '10m'
       headers:
         - name: Accept
           value: application/json
         - name: User-Agent
           value: Wasmer-CronJob

   ```
   - `path` *(str, required)* – The request URL path.
   - `method` *(str, Optional)* – HTTP method (defaults to `GET`).
   - `headers` *(list[object[name, value]], Optional)* – HTTP headers as
     yaml objects. The objects have two fields, `name` which is the
     header name, and `value` which is the value of header field.
   - `body` *(str, Optional)* – Request body.
   - `timeout` *(duration, Optional)* – Maximum time to wait for
     a response.

## Example Jobs Configuration

Below are examples of various job types based on their trigger and
action.


### Fetch job

This job fetches the `/` path on it's app every 15 minutes.
```yaml
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
package: wasmer/hello
jobs:
  - name: ping-server-every-15-minutes
    trigger: '*/15 * * * *'
    action:
      fetch:
        path: /
        timeout: 30s
```


### Execute job

This job runs `php --version` every minute.

```yaml
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
package: wasmer/wordpress
jobs:
  - name: check-php-version
    trigger: '*/1 * * * *'
    execute:
      command: php
      cli_args: ["--version"]
```

### Post deployment job

This job fetches the `/warm-up-caches` path on it's app after
each deployment.

```yaml
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
package: wasmer/hello
jobs:
  - name: ping-server-every-15-minutes
    trigger: post-deployment
    action:
      fetch:
        path: /warm-up-caches
        timeout: 30s
```


## Use Cases

- **Post-deployment setup:** The `installation` job ensures necessary
  setup commands run after deployment.
- **Scheduled background tasks:** The `wp-cron` job triggers
  WordPress’s cron system every 15 minutes.
