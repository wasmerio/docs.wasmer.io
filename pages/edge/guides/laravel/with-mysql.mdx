For data store, why not start with a relational database classic: MySQL.

You can set up a MySQL-compatible serverless database:
* TiDB Cloud - https://tidbcloud.com/

## Laravel with MySQL-compatible TiDB

You can also use TiDB in Wasmer Edge. TiDB is mostly MySQL-compatible (although it has some minor incompatiblities).
