# Wasmer Runtime

The Wasmer Runtime is the engine that allows running WebAssembly modules and Wasmer packages anywhere.

Wasmer can be used as a [library](/runtime/sdk) from any programming language, or as a standalone runtime via the [`Wasmer CLI`](/runtime/cli).

## Features

- **Secure** by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled.
- **Fast**. Run WebAssembly at near-native speeds.
- **Pluggable**. Embeddable in multiple programming languages
- Compliant with latest WebAssembly Proposals (SIMD, Reference Types, Threads, ...)

## Backends

The Wasmer Runtime supports multiple backends, depending on your needs:

### Native backends:

- **Singlepass**: A single-pass compiler for fast compilation times and low memory usage.
- **Cranelift**: A fast compiler backend with a focus on compile times, and runtime performance.
- **LLVM**: A compiler backend that uses LLVM for optimization and code generation.

### Integration backends:

- **Browser**: it allows running Wasmer fully in the browser (via `wasm-bindgen`).
- **JavascriptCore**: it allows running Wasmer using the WebAssembly engine inside JavascriptCore
- **V8** _(coming soon)_: it allows running Wasmer using the WebAssembly engine inside V8
