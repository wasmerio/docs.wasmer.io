# Introduction

Welcome to the Wasmer Documentation! ðŸ‘‹
[Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/) is an ecosystem based on WebAssembly that allows running applications anywhere: in the browser, embedded in your favorite programming language, or standalone in the server.

## Ecosystem

1. [Wasmer Runtime](/runtime): allows running Wasmer containers anywhere
2. [Wasmer Registry](/registry): explore containers from the community and distribute your own
3. [Wasmer Edge](/edge): run containers on Wasmer distributed Edge infrastructure

## SDKs

Wasmer is available in multiple programming languages and operating systems in the shape of SDKs.
Using these SDKs, it's possible to embed wasmer modules compiled from other languages into your application.
We have set up the SDKs to allow using Wasmer easily anywhere:

* [Wasmer JavaScript SDK](/sdk/wasmer-js): run your Wasmer packages in Javascript
