# Volumes

Volumes provide persistent disk storage for applications.

They also support remote access with any S3 compatible client.


<Callout type="warning">
In the current initial implementation, volumes are restricted to a single
[Edge region](/edge/learn/regions).

Volumes also at the moment only provide *read-write-many* semantics.
Due to the automatic auto-scaling for apps, this means that volumes are not currently
well-suited for databases or other more complex use cases that require a single writer.

Keep in mind that volumes can be accessed concurrently, and even from different
nodes.

These restrictions (including the single-region restriction) will be lifted
in the future.
</Callout>

## Create and Use Volumes 

* Every app may have multiple volumes.
* Each volume has a name, which must be unique for the application.
* Volumes can be mounted at a chosen path.
* Each volume can be mounted multiple times.

Simply extend your [app configuration](/edge/configuration) with a `volumes`
section:

```yaml filename="app.yaml" copy
# ...

volumes:
  # A name for your volume.
  # Must be unique for the given app.
  - name: data
    # Create a persistent volume named "data" in `/data`.
	mount: /data

  - name: more_data
    # Create a persistent volume named "more_data" in `/other_mntpoint`.
	mount: /other_mntpoint
```

This will create two new volumes: "data", which will be mounted at `/data` and "more_data" which will be mounted at `/other_mntpoint`.

Now just re-deploy your app with `wasmer deploy`, and the volume will be automatically created.

Your application can now use the mount path and treat it as persistent storage.

<Callout type="warning">
The name of a volume acts as a unique identifier.
If you change the name the old volume - including it's data - will be deleted!
</Callout>

### Deleting Volumes

To delete a volume, simply remove it from your app configuration and re-deploy.
The data will be purged, and your app will not have access to the volume anymore.

<Callout type="warning">
If you rename or remove a volume from the `app.yaml` configuration,
all data will be deleted when you deploy, and can not be recovered.

Make sure this is what you want before deploying!
</Callout>

## Inspecting Volumes

You can inspect volumes in two ways:

* in the web frontend on your app dashboard:
  Go to the "Storage" tab - you will see a list of volumes with their size.
* using the CLI:
  Run `wasmer app volumes list [app]` to list all volumes and their sizes.

## Remotely Accessing Volumes

Volumes are not only available to your apps, but can also be remotely accessed
through the standard S3 API, or through a builtin web UI.

You can use the CLI to retrieve the credentials:

```bash
wasmer app volumes credentials --format=json
```

This will print the S3 API URL, access key and secret key in the JSON format.


<Callout type="info">
You can visit the above URL in your browser to access a builtin web UI!
</Callout>

### Configuring rclone

[rclone](https://rclone.org/) is a popular CLI client that allows full access
to your volumes. It even allows mounting a volume to your local machine!

You can get an rclone configuration snippet through the CLI:

```bash
wasmer app volumes credentials --format=rclone
```

This will print out a configuration snippet that can be added to the rclone
configuration file.

<Callout type="info">
The config file is usually located at `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`, but you
can retrieve the active path with `rclone config file`.
</Callout>


Some examples of using rclone:

(Note: replace `<target>` with the name of the rclone target)

```bash
# List all volumes in this app:
rclone lsd <target>:

# List files in a given volume:
rclone lsd <target>:<volume-name>

# Copy a file to a volume:
rclone copy ./local-filename <target>:<volume-name>/remote-filename

# Mount a volume to a local directory
mkdir my-volume
rclone mount <target>:<volume-name> ./my-volume
```

### Rotating credentials
In order to rotate (i.e. automatically assign a different value) the credentials tied to your volumes, 
you can simply run this command with the CLI: 

```bash
wasmer app volumes rotate-secrets 
```

This command will rotate their values and show the new ones directly in the CLI.
