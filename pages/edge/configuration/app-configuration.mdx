# Wasmer Edge Configuration

Wasmer Edge's configuration is stored in a `app.yaml` file in the root of your project.

## Example

For a basic static site this file contains the following information:

```yaml copy
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
name: my-sample-site
description: A sample site for demonstration (optional)
package: wasmer/my-sample-site

# Specify environment variables
env:
  MY_VAR: "my-value123"
```

## Fields

### `kind`

The `kind` field is used to identify the type of configuration file. It is required and is a constant set to `wasmer.io/App.v0`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This constant field might be used in the future to support multiple
  configuration formats.
</Callout>

### `name`

The `name` field is used to identify the name of the application. It is **required** and must be unique.

- Required: `true`
- Required format: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`

### `description`

The `description` field is used to provide a description of the application. It is **optional** and can be any string.

- Required: `false`

### `package`

The `package` field is used to specify the name of the package to deploy.
It is **required** and must specify a package published to the Wasmer registry.

Note: if you have a wasmer.toml in the same directory as the `app.yaml`, `wasmer deploy` will automatically prompt you to publish a new version of the package.

- Required: `true`

### `env`

Specify environment variables for the app.
Must be a key-value map.

Example:
```yaml
env:
  MY_VAR: "my-value123"
```

- Required: `false`

### `debug`

The `debug` field is used to enable debug mode for the application. This in turn will show detailed error messages if a request fails, instead of a generic error. It is **optional** and can be any boolean.

- Required: `false`
- Default: `false`

## Sample Configuration

This sample configuration is for a python based flask application.

```yaml copy
---
kind: wasmer.io/App.v0
name: wasmer-python-flask-server-myapp-example
package: wasmer/python-flask-server-myapp-example@0.1.0
debug: false
env:
